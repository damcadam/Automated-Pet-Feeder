# Automated-Pet-Feeder

## Desription
**Authors:** Darius McAdam, Kyle Bell, and Evan Kaloupek  
**Project Members:** Darius McAdam, Kyle Bell, Evan Kaloupek, Luke Price, Hunter Sovboda, and Siyi Xiao  
**Date:** Fall 2021  
**Purpose:** Capstone project for Mechanical Engineering Senior Design I (ME 574)

The objective of the ME 574 project was to design and manufacture an automated pet feeder for a cat or a small dog. The pet feeder needed to be able to dispense food, sechdule feeding times, and give the user feedback on the number of calories the pet has consumed. 

## Code
**Language:** C++  
**Organziation:** The script thinks of the pet feeder as a state machine. Each menu is represented as a different state. The current state determines what code runs in the Arduino's loop.

Most of the code is made up of menus that tell the Arduino what should be printed to the LCD.T
